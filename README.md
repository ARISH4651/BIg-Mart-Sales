#  Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to forecast sales of different products across various outlets.  
By analyzing product and outlet features, we build machine learning models to identify key factors influencing sales and improve prediction accuracy.

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** Big Mart Sales dataset  
- **Features:**  
  - Product-level: Item Identifier, Item Weight, Item Type, Item MRP, Item Fat Content  
  - Outlet-level: Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, Outlet Type  
- **Target Variable:** Item Outlet Sales  

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of numerical features (MRP, Item Weight, Sales).  
- Count plots for categorical features (Item Type, Outlet Type, etc.).  
- Relationship visualizations:  
  - Item MRP vs Sales  
  - Outlet Size / Location vs Sales  

---

## ðŸ›  Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (`Item_Weight`, `Outlet_Size`).  
- Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.  
- Feature scaling (if required).  
- Train-test split for model evaluation.

---

##  Models Implemented
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

---

##  Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:  
  - RÂ² Score  

---

##  Key Insights
- Item MRP and Outlet Type have the highest impact on sales.  
- Random Forest and XGBoost provided the best prediction performance.  
- Feature engineering significantly improved accuracy.
